  + President Marcos saying that public school teachers need to get overload and overtime pay this School Year.

  + President Marcos mentioning about the operation to find the people involved in the cause of some E-Sabungeros' mysterious disappearances.

#### My reflection about SONA2025:
  + For me, I personally believe that Marcos' SONA was a turning point for his administration as a president of our country. This is because I noticed while he delivered his speech, he was, most of the time, speaking in Filipino rather than in English as his usual. I think the reason for this is that he is more determined to connect more with us Filipinos. Aside from this, I also repect him as he honestly admitted that we are still short in some important essential services like jobs, rice, and access to renewable energy. This might be a problem in the present but I'm actually happy that the governement is listening to the everyday needs of us Filipinos.
  
    Although he as our president has been more empathetic towards us, he wasn't able to present some of the issues we are facing. One of this is the silence towards VP Sarah Duterte's impreachment is still noticeable up until now. This issue made me think that his speech was somehow incomplete, because I feel like he is hiding truths that the public does not know about. Lastly, is the issue about our economy. Even though economic progress is somewhat promising on "paper", some of us are still experiencing pain and hardships. This issue made me feel hopeful that the government would make there promises come true for a better future for us Filipinos.
